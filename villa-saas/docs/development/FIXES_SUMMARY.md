# Fixes Summary

## 1. Fixed Availability Calendar Route

### Problem
The `/availability-calendar` endpoint was failing with:
- `propertyId` was undefined (coming from query params)
- Dates were showing as "Invalid Date"

### Solution
Added proper validation for query parameters in `/home/eli/Documents/Villacustom/villa-saas/apps/backend/src/modules/availability/availability.routes.ts`:

1. Check if all required parameters are present (`propertyId`, `startDate`, `endDate`)
2. Validate date formats using `isNaN(date.getTime())`
3. Check if end date is after start date
4. Return appropriate error messages for each validation failure

## 2. Fixed Overlapping Pricing Periods Issue

### Problem
When creating a new pricing period that overlaps with an existing one, the system was:
- Rejecting the creation with an overlap error
- This prevented the intended behavior of using priority-based pricing

### Solution
Removed the overlap validation in `/home/eli/Documents/Villacustom/villa-saas/apps/backend/src/modules/periods/periods.routes.ts`:

1. Removed overlap checks from both `POST /` (create) and `PATCH /:id` (update) endpoints
2. Added comments explaining that overlaps are allowed and priority determines which period applies
3. The pricing service already handles overlapping periods correctly by using the highest priority

### How the Priority System Works
- Multiple periods can overlap the same dates
- The period with the highest priority value is applied
- This allows for seasonal pricing, special promotions, etc.
- Example: Base period (priority 0), Summer season (priority 10), Special event (priority 20)

## Testing

Created a test script at `/home/eli/Documents/Villacustom/villa-saas/test-availability-route.js` to verify the availability route fixes.

The frontend already correctly handles overlapping periods:
- `InteractivePricingCalendar` component allows selecting dates
- `QuickPriceEditor` automatically calculates priority for new periods
- It sets the new priority to be 10 higher than any overlapping period
